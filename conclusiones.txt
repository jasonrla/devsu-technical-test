Here are the findings from the tests:

E2E tests
---------

1. Different alerts are managed in the flow, for example when adding a product to the cart and when purchased is successful
2. Some elements such as Home, Cart, Place Order, do not have an id, so if you use an xpath or css, 
there is a possible error if this change in the html
3. It lets to make a purchase if no items has been added to the cart
4. The values of the form have no format validation, so you can enter any character even in the card field.
5. The country field is displayed as a text box, but it would be better if it is displayed as a listbox with the list of countries to select.
The card, month and year fields should be displayed in a way that the user knows that it is a payment platform,
so the card data should not be displayed in full but you could use asterisks as is commonly used. 
In addition a CVV (Card Verification Value) and email field are required, as these are data that payment platforms request for a transaction.
7. When a new purchase is made and a successful message is displayed, that message also includes the current date but it shows an incorrect month. 
To avoid errors in the tests and not to terminate the flow, the date is validated with this incorrect value.

API tests
---------

1. When signup with an "existing user", the status code should not be 200, instead it should be 409 Conflict
2. When signup with an "new user", the status code should not be 200, instead it should be 201 Created 
and the response should contain an indicator of success, currently is shown an empty string
3. When login with "correct credentials", the response should be in JSON format, currently it is shown as string
4. When login with "incorrect credentials", the status code should not be 200, instead it should be 401 Unauthorized
5. There is no user lockout implemented when logging in with "incorrect credentials" typically more than three times
